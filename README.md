# pipewire96
# Pipewire configuration files to force 96kHz S32LE 2 channel output with max quality resampling
# These scripts should enable 96kHz playback at 32 bit out through alsa as a 2 channel out.
# Tested on Arch and Manjaro.  Should work on others.  
# Released under GPLv2 from a noob in Canada.
# Install either system or user.  System requires root or sudo (obviously).
